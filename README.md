# Eat-Da-Burger

## Overview 
This application, Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat!

 The user can submit a burger's name and click the thumbs up button that will add their burgers name to the burgers name list on the bottom left of the screen. If the user clicks on the silverware button it will move the burger name to the Devour list on the bottom right of the screen. Once the user is done devouring their burger they can hit the trash button and their burger name is thrown into the trash!


## How it functions
 This application uses MySQL, Express, Node.js, Handlebars, and ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

## Credits
Activity 17-CatsApp was a big reference for this homework assignment. 
I went through the activity and refactored it and made changes where necessary to make it 
function with Burgers!
