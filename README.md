 The user can submit a burger's name and click the thumbs up button that will add their burgers name to the burgers name list on the bottom left of the screen. If the user clicks on the silverware button it will move the burger name to the Devour list on the bottom right of the screen. 






## How it functions
 This application uses MySQL, Inquirer, and Node.js. You may wish to jump start managing your employees by creating
 a database in MySQL and seed your database with a seed.sql file. You will have to navigate to the folder you saved the application and run npm install. Once the package is installed you can run node server.js and this command will start the application.
